# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here. The project follows Semantic
Versioning while pre-1.0 and uses one product version across release artifacts.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Near-full-screen views for the workspace terminal and task graph.
- Portable, Dedicated, and Private Cloud deployment variants.
- Independent Platform Dashboard releases.
- Stable Ingress, blue/green Runtime slots, durable admission, planned Session
  continuation, and Supervisor-owned rollback for Dedicated.
- Digest-pinned multi-architecture Private Cloud images, native Linux operator
  bundles, independent Dashboard upgrades, and state-machine lifecycle receipts.
- Release asset integrity checks, explicit vulnerability policy, and managed
  Windows Executor service install/uninstall lifecycle.
- A production-component Dashboard prototype harness with transport-boundary
  mock data and a browser interaction matrix.

### Changed

- Private Cloud runtime images now derive a digest-pinned, non-root Node.js
  runtime containing only required libraries and their package inventory.
- README architecture narrative now presents the pure-function Agent Kernel,
  Agent Runtime, and cloud-native service as one complete system.
- Thinking titles remain visible when collapsed, and reasoning direction now
  precedes the tool activity it introduces.
- Dashboard navigation, title, Composer, Operations, Product Outputs, Pipeline,
  Memo, Settings, responsive states, and Chinese localization use the shared
  product UI system.
- Session and Workspace information, cumulative usage, storage inventory,
  sub-agent activity, message timing, pinned prompts, hidden items, and
  responsive sidebars use denser production layouts.
- Ask User Choice supports single-choice, multiple-choice, and custom responses
  through one shared Dashboard and Host protocol.

### Fixed

- Pending Ask User Choice requests remain visible when Copilot emits an
  intermediate idle state before the user responds.
- Context progress animation, message metadata spacing, compact Choice cards,
  storage sorting, sidebar truncation, and narrow right-panel tabs retain their
  intended geometry.

### Release

- `v0.2.0`, after every gate in the public release readiness runbook passes.
- Kala branding and safer installation documentation; no automatic npm publishing.
