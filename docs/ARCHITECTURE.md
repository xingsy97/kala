# Architecture

**Status**: Normative for topology & responsibilities. Wire-level details live in [protocol/wire-protocol.md](protocol/wire-protocol.md); kernel-level details in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

## 1. The three processes

`agent-kernel` deploys as **three cooperating processes**. All three can run on one machine for local development; in production the split matters.

```
    - 
    -   DASHBOARD  (React SPA  -  static bundle served by Host)          - 
    -      -  Explorer (workspaces + sessions)                           - 
    -      -  Workbench (chat, inspector, replay, settings)              - 
    - 
                                -   Socket.IO (namespace: /dashboard)
                                - 
    - 
    -   HOST  (Node.js, has public IP)                                 - 
    -                                                                  - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -  Kernel                -     -  LLM Adapter           -           - 
    -      -  (pure FSM step)       -     -  (Anthropic/OpenAI/ - )  -           - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -  Host loop             -     -  Event log (JSONL)     -           - 
    -      -  (consumes effects,    -     -   ~/.agent-kernel/     -           - 
    -      -   dispatches events)   -     -    sessions/*.jsonl    -           - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -  agent tool (builtin)  -     -  Compaction driver     -           - 
    -      -  spawns child JSONL    -     -  (manual + auto,       -           - 
    -      -  session in workspace  -     -   writes compact_replaced)  -       - 
    -      -     -           - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -  Connection layer (Socket.IO server)               -          - 
    -      -    namespaces:  /dashboard   /executor             -          - 
    -      -    rooms:       session:<id>                       -          - 
    -      -    routing key: workspaceId (session  -  executor)   -          - 
    -      -          - 
    -     Also serves packages/dashboard/dist/ as static assets.       - 
    - 
                                 -   Socket.IO (namespace: /executor)
                                 -    -  executor dials OUT to host
                                 - 
    - 
    -   EXECUTOR (a WORKSPACE  -  the machine tools run on)              - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -  Announce: workspaceId, workspaceName, os,         -          - 
    -      -            runtime, sandboxRoots, tool names       -          - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -  Tool registry: read / write / edit / bash /       -          - 
    -      -                 grep / glob / ls / todowrite /     -          - 
    -      -                 web_search / bash_output /         -          - 
    -      -                 kill_shell                         -          - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -          - 
    -      -  Sandbox (working directory whitelist)             -          - 
    -      -  Background shell registry (bash --run-in-bg)      -          - 
    -      -          - 
    - 
```

## 2. Process responsibilities

### 2.1 Kernel (library, not a process)

Lives inside Host as `@agent-kernel/kernel`. Pure function `step(state, event, config)  -  { next, effects }`. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

**Not a process.** Do not deploy the kernel separately. It is a ~300 LOC pure-function library that Host imports.

### 2.2 Host

The only process with a **public IP** (or at least, reachable inbound by dashboard and executor).

**Responsibilities**:
- Own the kernel's `AgentState` for each active session (in-memory Map keyed by `sessionId`)
- Drive the FSM: pull events off an input queue, call `step`, dispatch resulting effects, feed responses back as events
- Talk to LLM providers via the LLM Adapter (translate `call_llm` effect  -  provider request  -  `llm_response` / `llm_error` event). Stream token deltas to the dashboard as `session:token_delta`; the JSONL log only records the final `llm_response`.
- Persist events to a JSONL log (append per `step` result). Recover on restart by folding the log and appending synthetic events for stuck pending tool calls / interrupted streams (see [event-log.md](protocol/event-log.md)  - 4.3).
- Broadcast state and events to subscribed dashboards; dispatch `call_tool` effects to the executor announcing the session's `workspaceId` (i.e. the machine the session is bound to)
- Serve two Socket.IO namespaces: `/dashboard` and `/executor`, rooms `session:<id>`, and serve the pre-built Dashboard bundle from `packages/dashboard/dist/`
- Drive context compaction (both auto via `contextPressureLevel === 'hard'` and manual via `client:compact` / the `/compact` slash command). The summarizer is invoked with the LLM adapter; the resulting `compact_replaced` event carries the summarizer `request`, `trigger`, and `responseUsage` for the timeline.
- Provide the host-side `agent` builtin tool: spawn a child JSONL session in the same workspace, inheriting the parent's `approvalMode`, and return the child's final assistant text.
- Auto-import LLM providers from `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.claude/settings.json`, merge with user-added providers in `~/.agent-kernel/config.json`, and expose them to the dashboard via `server:providers`.

**Non-goals**:
- Does not implement tools directly (executor does)
- Does not know about specific providers deeply  -  the LLM Adapter abstracts them

### 2.3 Executor

Lives close to the files it needs to touch. Dials **out** to Host via Socket.IO. Never accepts inbound connections.

**One executor per workspace, one workspace per machine.** The executor's `workspaceId` (a stable ULID persisted in `~/.agent-kernel/workspace-id`) is the routing key Host uses to dispatch tool calls; the `workspaceName` (defaults to `os.hostname()`) is the display label. Two executor processes with the same `workspaceId` are treated as replicas of the same workspace.

**Two forms**:

1. **Local Node daemon**: user runs `agent-kernel-executor --host wss://host.example.com`. Has access to a whitelisted working directory. Runs `bash`, `read`, `write`, etc. against the real filesystem. Also runs background shell tasks (see below).
2. **Browser WebContainer**: dashboard hosts an in-page executor via [WebContainer API](https://webcontainers.io/). Same tool implementations, but the filesystem is an in-memory vfs. Enables the "demo with just a URL" experience.

**Responsibilities**:
- On connect, `announce` its capabilities: `workspaceId`, `workspaceName`, `os`, `runtime`, `runtimeVersion`, `hostname`, `sandboxRoots`, and the list of tool names implemented
- Wait for `call_tool` messages (each carrying an optional `cwd` copied from `state.cwd`), execute them against the sandbox, and reply with `tool_result` (ok + content)
- Serve directory listings for `fs:list_dirs` requests (used by the create-session Finder-style picker)
- Manage a per-executor background shell registry: `bash { run_in_background: true }` starts a task and returns `{ taskId, note }`; subsequent `bash_output` polls stream logs; `kill_shell` terminates. From the parent session's perspective these are just three normal tools  -  no new event kind is required.
- Handle `cancel` messages targeting a specific `callId`

**Non-goals**:
- No LLM knowledge
- No agent state
- No approval logic (approval happens in kernel via `request_approval` effect)

### 2.4 Dashboard

React SPA. Built to a static bundle (`packages/dashboard/dist/`) and served by Host  -  port 3000 is Host, not vite. Local `pnpm dev` still runs a vite dev server on 5288 for hot-reload during development, but the shipped experience is served from `dist`.

**Layout**:
- **Explorer** (left rail): a two-level tree of workspaces (announced executors) with their sessions grouped by time bucket. Each session row shows title, status, event count, and `currentCwd`. A workspace's Info icon opens the read-only workspace metadata dialog; a session's Info icon opens the session metadata dialog.
- **Workbench** (right): session toolbar (title, cwd editor, theme + inspector controls), chat transcript, composer (model picker, context usage ring based on `ModelInfo.contextWindow` / `AgentConfig.contextLimit`, send button, host status), and the Inspector / History / Settings / Approvals panels.
- **ActivityBar** (bottom): live runtime status, approval mode picker, permission banners.

**Responsibilities**:
- Connect to Host via Socket.IO (`/dashboard` namespace) with a `sessionId` and role
- Show the chat transcript (rendering text + image blocks), the inspector, the event timeline (with a compact boundary marker when `compact_replaced` fired), the replay/fork UI, the Settings pane (providers, models, approval mode default, host)
- Send user events (`user_message`, `user_approve`, `user_reject`, `cancel`) and control messages (`client:set_approval_mode`, `client:set_cwd`, `client:set_model`, `client:compact`, `client:rename_session`, `client:delete_session`, `client:create_session`, `client:list_dirs`) to Host

**Non-goals**:
- Never talks to Executor directly
- Never talks to LLM providers directly
- Never runs tool code

## 3. Turn lifecycle

The clearest way to understand the system is to trace one end-to-end turn.

**Scenario**: User asks "Read `/tmp/notes.md` and tell me what's in it."

     -                          -     -  effect: call_llm                          - 
     -   -  state:thinking  -   -                                                -

     -                          -                                                - 
     -                          -   -  response("The file says - ")  -   - 
     -                          -  step(thinking, llm_response)                  - 
     -                          -     -  append assistant msg (text only)          - 
     -                          -     -  status: done                              - 
     -                          -     -  effect: finish                            - 
     -   -  state:done  -   -                                                - 
```

### 3.2 Event log after this turn

The event log (see [event-log.md](protocol/event-log.md)) records every `step` input. For the above turn:

```jsonl
{"seq":1,"ts":"...","event":{"kind":"user_message","text":"Read /tmp/notes.md and tell me what's in it."}}
{"seq":2,"ts":"...","event":{"kind":"llm_response","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool_call","callId":"c1","name":"read","input":{"path":"/tmp/notes.md"}}]},"usage":{"inputTokens":142,"outputTokens":38}}}
{"seq":3,"ts":"...","event":{"kind":"tool_result","callId":"c1","ok":true,"content":"..."}}
{"seq":4,"ts":"...","event":{"kind":"llm_response","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"The file says - "}]},"usage":{"inputTokens":210,"outputTokens":56}}}
```

**Given these four events + the session's `AgentConfig`, `fold` reproduces the exact final state.** This is the replayability guarantee.

### 3.3 Adding an approval gate

If the user had asked "Delete `/tmp/notes.md`" and the `bash` tool has `requiresApproval: true`, the middle of the sequence becomes:

```
     -                          -  step(thinking, llm_response with tool_call bash)
     -                          -     -  pending: [bash/awaiting_approval]
     -                          -     -  status: awaiting_approval
     -                          -     -  effect: request_approval
     -   -  state:awaiting_approval + approval UI  - 
     - 
     -   -  user_approve  -   - 
     -                          -  step(awaiting_approval, user_approve)
     -                          -     -  pending: [bash/dispatched]
     -                          -     -  status: executing_tools
     -                          -     -  effect: call_tool
     -                          -   -  call_tool(bash)  -  executor
```

`user_reject` is symmetric but synthesizes a `tool_result(ok=false, content=reason)` and skips the executor round-trip.

---

## 4. Data flow patterns

### 4.1 Effects are commands, events are facts

- **Effect** (`call_llm`, `call_tool`, `request_approval`, `finish`, `emit_error`): kernel says "I need this to happen".
- **Event** (`llm_response`, `tool_result`, `user_approve`, `user_reject`): host says "this happened".

Every effect that changes downstream state produces at least one event that feeds back into the kernel. Effects that don't produce events (`finish`, `emit_error`) are pure notifications  -  nothing else to do.

### 4.2 Broadcast vs. dispatch

- **Broadcast to Dashboard** (`state:changed`, `event:appended`): Host pushes state updates to all dashboards subscribed to a session. One-to-many.
- **Dispatch to Executor** (`call_tool`, `cancel`): Host sends to exactly one executor for the session. Uses Socket.IO ACK to correlate the response with the `callId`.

### 4.3 One workspace per session

A session is bound to exactly one workspace (i.e. one executor / one machine) at create time. All of that session's `call_tool` effects route to the executor announcing the same `workspaceId`. Sessions whose workspace has no attached executor appear offline in the Explorer but their logs remain readable. Multi-executor per session (routing different tool names to different machines) is intentionally out of scope  -  running tools across machines within a single turn is a distributed-system problem the kernel does not want to own.

---

## 5. Failure modes and recovery

| What fails | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| LLM API returns 5xx / timeout | LLM Adapter | Emit `llm_error` event  -  kernel  -  `error` status. Host may replace state (retry policy is host-owned) |
| Tool execution throws | Executor | Reply with `tool_result(ok=false, content=<error>)`. Kernel treats as normal tool result |
| Executor disconnects mid-call | Socket.IO ACK timeout | Host synthesizes `tool_result(ok=false, content="executor disconnected")` |
| Dashboard disconnects | Socket.IO reconnect | On reconnect, Host sends the full current state + a stream of events since last-seen `cursor` |
| Host crashes mid-turn | External (systemd / process manager) | Restart. Load rebuilds state from JSONL, then appends synthetic `user_approve` + failed `tool_result` for pending tool calls, or an `[interrupted]` `llm_response` for stuck LLM streams  -  see [event-log.md](protocol/event-log.md)  - 4.3 |
| Kernel bug | Would surface as an invariant violation in tests | Fix, ship, replay is safe because event log is unchanged |

**Guarantee**: as long as the event log survives, the session survives. Nothing else is authoritative.

---

## 6. Storage model

### 6.1 Sessions on disk

```
~/.agent-kernel/
 -  config.json                        # user config: default provider, tokens, executor URL
 -  sessions/
     -  2026-07-04T17-30-15_s1.jsonl   # per-session event log
     -  2026-07-04T18-01-02_s2.jsonl
     -  snapshots/
         -  s1_cursor_100.json         # optional state snapshots for fast replay
```

**Naming**: `<iso-timestamp>_<sessionId>.jsonl`. Sortable by creation time. Session IDs are host-generated ULIDs.

**Snapshots**: purely a performance optimization. A snapshot is a JSON dump of `AgentState` at a given cursor. Replay can start from the nearest snapshot instead of the beginning of the log. Deleting snapshots is always safe.

### 6.2 What's in memory

Host keeps a `Map<sessionId, { state: AgentState, config: AgentConfig }>` for active sessions. Inactive sessions may be evicted; a fresh `user_message` triggers a load-from-log.

---

## 7. Local vs cloud deployment

The topology is the same. What changes is **who has the public IP**.

**Local dev** (everything on your laptop):
- Host listens on `localhost:3000` and serves the dashboard bundle from `packages/dashboard/dist/`
- Executor connects to `ws://localhost:3000/executor`
- User browses to `http://localhost:3000`  -  Host serves both the SPA and the `/socket.io` endpoint
- For dashboard development, `pnpm --filter dashboard dev` starts vite on 5288 with hot-reload; production behavior is `dist`-served on 3000
- One `pnpm dev` builds everything, starts Host, and attaches a local executor

**Cloud + local executor** (the differentiating deployment):
- Host deployed to Fly.io / Railway, reachable at `wss://host.example.com`
- Executor runs on your laptop, dials out: `agent-kernel-executor --host wss://host.example.com --session <id>`
- Dashboard hosted static (Vercel), served at `https://app.example.com`, connects to `wss://host.example.com/dashboard`
- The laptop needs **no inbound port**. It creates the outbound WS. This is the NAT/firewall workaround baked in.

**Full cloud** (demo with just a URL):
- Host + Dashboard as above
- Executor runs in the browser via WebContainer, no local install
- Only meaningful for demos / disposable sandboxes

---

## 8. Design decisions cross-reference

Every non-obvious topology choice above has an ADR:

| Choice | ADR |
|---|---|
