# Sub-agents  -  Design v2

Status: live inline observability implemented; interruption implemented; agent-type registry still planned
Owner: host + dashboard
Related: [tools.md](./tools.md), [protocol/wire-protocol.md](./protocol/wire-protocol.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md), [adr/0014-subagent-approval-mode.md](./adr/0014-subagent-approval-mode.md)

## 1. What we already have

A minimum-viable sub-agent stack has been in-tree for a while:

- **Tool schema**  -  `agent` tool in `packages/executor/src/tools/agent.ts`. Fields: `prompt` (required), `model`, `tools` (allowlist).
- **Host-side handler**  -  `packages/host/src/extensions/agent-tool.ts`. Creates a *child JSONL session* via `SessionStore.create()` with `parentSessionId` + `parentCursor` set, inherits `workspaceId`/`workspaceName`/`cwd`, forces `initialApprovalMode: 'allow_all'` (see [ADR 0014](./adr/0014-subagent-approval-mode.md)), then drives the child through the host loop and returns an enveloped result.
- **Depth limit**  -  `AgentConfig.maxAgentDepth` (default 3) counted by walking `parentSessionId` links.
- **Loop dispatch**  -  `packages/host/src/loop.ts:317` special-cases `AGENT_TOOL_NAME`, so a `call_tool` effect for `agent` invokes `runAgentTool()` instead of the executor bridge.
- **Store parent-child links**  -  `SessionRecord` carries `parentSessionId` + `parentCursor` (`packages/host/src/store/session.ts`). `SessionReadyEvent` in `packages/shared/src/protocol.ts` propagates them to clients.
- **Explorer + metadata dialog**  -  the dashboard shows "fork of `<sha> - `" in the session list and a "Parent" jump in `SessionMetadataDialog`.

This works: the sub-agent runs, the parent gets its final text back as a `tool_result`, the operator can watch the child inline, and an active child can be interrupted from the parent card. The remaining product gaps are:

1. **The tool is still under-discoverable.** The `agent` tool is in the schema, but no built-in agent "types" ship yet in the Codex/Claude Code sense, and there is no authoring UI for custom types.
2. **The registry is still a planned config layer.** The runtime path is intentionally isolated child sessions today; named agent types are the next ergonomic layer, not a different execution model.
3. **Background sub-agents remain out of scope.** Children still block the parent tool call until they complete, fail, or are interrupted.

We are keeping the backend architecture  -  it is quietly solid. This document specifies (a) the wire events + dashboard rendering to make sub-agent runs observable inline, and (b) a minimal "agent types" facility so users can define reusable prompts + tool policies.

## 2. Reference designs

### Claude Code  -  `Agent`/`Task` tool

- Tool input: `{ subagent_type, description, prompt, model?, run_in_background?, isolation? }`. `subagent_type` names one of a registered set (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, custom user-defined types).
- **Isolated inner loop.** Fresh context, own tool loop, own transcript file at `<agent-log-root>/{project}/{sessionId}/subagents/agent-{agentId}.jsonl`.
- Foreground blocks the parent turn; background (default since v2.1.198) runs concurrently, permission prompts surface in the parent naming the sub-agent.
- Parent can emit **multiple `Agent` tool_use blocks in one message** to run children in parallel.
- Tool return: single text string. Trailer `agentId: <id>` appended so parent can `SendMessage` to resume it.
- Custom types = markdown-with-frontmatter files under `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`. Frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`. Body = system prompt. Hot-reloaded.
- Recursion allowed up to depth 5.
- Model resolution: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env  -  per-invocation `model`  -  definition frontmatter  -  parent's model.

### Codex CLI  -  `multi_agents_v2`

- **Non-blocking spawn.** `spawn_agent` returns immediately with `{ task_name, nickname }`. Parent uses separate `send_message`, `followup_task`, `wait_agent`, `list_agents`, `interrupt_agent` tools. Content flows through a side-channel of `SubAgentActivityEvent`s rendered in a distinct TUI pane, **not** through the `tool_result` of the spawn call.
- **Fork axis.** `fork_turns: "none" | "all" | <int>` decides how much parent history the child sees. `all` = full parent transcript forked in (model/reasoning/role overrides rejected in that mode).
- Roles: TOML files under `<codex_home>/agents/*.toml` or inline in `config.toml`, each providing a `ConfigToml` layer (tool policy, model, reasoning effort).
- Per-spawn overrides: `model`, `reasoning_effort`, `service_tier`.

### opencode  -  `task` tool

- Simpler synchronous default. `task` tool input: `{ description, prompt, subagent_type, task_id?, background? }`. Child = new `Session` with `parentID = ctx.sessionID`, own inner loop.
- Returns a wrapped envelope: `<task id=" - " state="completed"><task_result> - final text - </task_result></task>`  -  only the child's last text part; the tool description explicitly says "The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user."
- Child sessions ARE navigable in the TUI as sibling sessions.
- Two ways to define agents: JSON under `agent.<name>` in `opencode.json`, or markdown with YAML frontmatter under `.opencode/agent/` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/agents/` (global). Filename = agent name.
- Per-agent tool policy: `permission.{edit,bash,webfetch,task}` and per-tool + bash-glob rules, `allow | ask | deny`, last-match-wins. Auto-denies recursive `task` and `todowrite` unless re-enabled.

### What we're taking and skipping

- **Take from Claude Code:** the *concept* of named agent types (markdown + frontmatter), the depth cap on recursion, model-inheritance chain, and multiple parallel `agent` tool_use blocks in one assistant message (already free  -  the loop already dispatches parallel tool calls).
- **Take from opencode:** the wrapped envelope result (`<task id="..." state="..."> - </task>`) so the parent's transcript is self-describing without needing the dashboard to hide raw output. Also the "child session navigable as sibling" affordance  -  we half-have this via Explorer.
- **Skip Codex's non-blocking spawn model.** Our synchronous flow is simpler and matches how the LLM already thinks. We can revisit if/when we want long-lived background research agents.
- **Skip Codex's `fork_turns: "all"`.** Sharing parent history is a footgun  -  the child bloats context immediately, and if the parent later compacts, the child's transcript becomes hard to reason about. Fresh context per sub-agent is a real feature.

## 3. Design principles

1. **Backend is already right  -  do not re-plumb.** The sub-agent runs as an isolated child session in `SessionStore` with its own JSONL log; the parent sees a synchronous `tool_result`. Don't change that.
2. **Inline observability is the missing feature.** The dashboard should render a sub-agent's transcript *inside the parent's transcript* as a live, collapsible card  -  not as a separate tab you have to hunt for.
3. **The child's dashboard socket state stays independent.** Users can still open the child in its own tab if they want the full-screen experience. The parent-inline view is a *summary/preview* that reuses the same transcript data.
4. **One event stream is authoritative.** The child session already emits `event:appended`/`state:changed` through the loop's broadcast; the dashboard just needs to subscribe to the child room while it's viewing the parent, and know which `tool_call` on the parent maps to which child session.
5. **Agent types are a config layer, not a fork of the loop.** They resolve into a `{ systemPrompt, allowedTools, model }` triple that gets merged into the child's `AgentConfig` at spawn time. No new code paths, just a lookup + merge.

## 4. Where things live

```

## 5. Protocol

### Envelope in `tool_result.content`

The parent's `tool_result` today is the child's last-assistant text. We wrap it in a small envelope to make it self-describing and to give the dashboard a stable place to hang the "expand the child transcript" affordance without heuristics:

```
<sub_agent
  session_id="<child sessionId>"
  agent_type="<name>"
  status="completed"
  turns="7"
  duration_ms="42137"
>
<result>
 - final assistant text - 
</result>
</sub_agent>
```

The wrapper is text (not JSON) so it renders acceptably even without special-case UI, and so it survives log compaction. The dashboard parses the opening tag with a permissive regex and, on match, renders `<SubAgentCard>` instead of the raw text. If the tag is malformed or missing, we fall back to the plain grouped-tool-call renderer  -  so the feature degrades to "just text" cleanly.

For failures (`{ ok: false }`), the envelope is `status="failed"` with a `<error> - </error>` block instead of `<result>`. User interruption and parent-cancel cascade use `status="cancelled"` with the cancellation reason in `<error>`.

### New push events

Two events, on the `/dashboard` namespace only:

- `server:sub_agent_started`  -  emitted by the host at the moment `runAgentTool()` calls `SessionStore.create()` for the child. Fields:
  ```ts
  {
    parentSessionId: string
    parentCallId: string           // the agent tool's callId
    childSessionId: string
    agentType?: string
    prompt: string
    model?: string
    startedAt: string              // ISO 8601
  }
  ```
- `server:sub_agent_finished`  -  emitted just before `runAgentTool()` returns. Fields:
  ```ts
  {
    parentSessionId: string
    parentCallId: string
    childSessionId: string
    status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'
    turns: number                  // child.state.cursor (approximate)
    durationMs: number
    finishedAt: string
    error?: string                 // present when status !== 'completed'
  }
  ```

Both events are fanned into the parent's `session:<parentSessionId>` room. The dashboard uses them to (a) show a live "N sub-agents running" indicator, (b) transition the SubAgentCard from "in progress" to "completed", and (c) know the `childSessionId` before the tool_result envelope arrives  -  so it can start streaming the child transcript inline while the child is still running.

### Child transcript subscription

The dashboard, upon receiving `server:sub_agent_started`, calls the existing `session:subscribe` (or equivalent  -  the room-join pattern used for regular sessions) with `childSessionId`. From that point it receives all `event:appended` / `state:changed` events for the child, exactly the same as if the child were the active session. The parent view multiplexes them by session id.

We do NOT add a new "subscribe to child from within parent" RPC  -  the existing per-session room infrastructure is sufficient.

### Client interruption

The dashboard can interrupt a live child from the inline `SubAgentCard` without opening the child session:

```ts
socket.emit('client:interrupt_sub_agent', {
  parentSessionId,
  parentCallId,
  childSessionId, // optional guard against stale UI rows
})
```

The host marks the active sub-agent entry as cancelled, then dispatches `cancel` to the child session through the same loop path used by normal session cancellation. That keeps LLM stream aborts and executor tool cancellation in the loop-owned abort registry instead of creating a second cancellation channel.

If the child already finished, the host broadcasts a `session:error` to the parent session with `scope: 'host'` and leaves the finished envelope unchanged.

### RPC additions

Two dashboard RPCs to make the feature complete:

- `agent_types:list`  -  returns the currently-loaded agent type registry: `{ types: Array<{ name, description, model?, tools?, systemPromptPreview? }> }`. Used by the Composer / future "@agent-name" affordance.
- `sub_agent:list`  -  returns children of a given parent: `{ parentSessionId, children: Array<{ childSessionId, agentType?, status, startedAt, finishedAt? }> }`. Read from `SessionStore` by scanning records with `parentSessionId === X`. Used by the dashboard to reconstruct sub-agent cards when replaying an existing session log.

Both are ack-response RPCs following the same pattern as `bg:list` / `fs:list_dirs`.

## 6. Agent types

Agent types are named `(systemPrompt, allowedTools?, model?, description)` bundles resolved at spawn time. Definition sources, in priority order (higher wins on name collision):

1. **Inline in the `agent` tool call**  -  the parent passes `{ agent_type: 'researcher' }` and the type is looked up in the registry. If `agent_type` is omitted, we use a generic fallback ("general-purpose"  -  same system prompt as the parent, all tools).
2. **Workspace-local**  -  `.agent-kernel/agents/<name>.md` (walked up from `cwd`). Frontmatter + body, like Claude Code.
3. **User-global**  -  `~/.config/agent-kernel/agents/<name>.md`.
4. **Built-ins**  -  a small set shipped in `packages/host/src/agent-types/*.md`, initially just `general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan` for parity with the reference designs.

Frontmatter schema:

```yaml
---
name: string                    # canonical id, must match filename
description: string             # one-line, shown to the LLM in tool schema
model: string?                  # optional model override
tools: string[]?                # allowlist by tool name
disallowedTools: string[]?      # denylist (applied after allowlist)
maxTurns: number?               # cap child loop turns (default: inherit)
---
```

Body = system prompt.

**Loading**: on startup, `packages/host/src/agent-registry.ts` walks the three paths and constructs an in-memory `Map<name, AgentTypeDefinition>`. On file change (fs.watch), it reloads. Missing files simply reduce the registry.

**Advertising to the LLM**: the `agent` tool's `description` field is regenerated at registry-load time to enumerate the available types, e.g.:

```
Spawn a sub-agent to handle a focused sub-task. Available agent_type values:
  - general-purpose (default): general reasoning + all tools
  - Explore: fast read-only research (no write/edit/bash tools)
  - Plan: architectural planning; produces a plan, does not execute
  - <workspace-local types loaded from .agent-kernel/agents/>
```

This keeps the LLM oriented without needing per-type separate tools (Claude Code's pattern of exposing each type as its own tool inflates the tool schema for the parent).

**Merging at spawn**: `runAgentTool()` currently constructs `filteredAgentConfig(parent.config, effect.input.tools)`. We extend it to:

1. Look up the requested `agent_type` (if any) in the registry.
2. Merge type-level `systemPrompt`, `tools`, `model`, `maxTurns` on top of the parent config.
3. Apply the per-call `tools` array as a further intersection (never expansion  -  a call cannot re-enable tools the type denies).
4. Apply per-call `model` on top (per-call wins).

## 7. Dashboard UX

### Inline card

When the parent's timeline contains a `tool_call` for `agent`, the chat panel renders a `SubAgentCard` instead of the generic `ToolCallGroupBlock`. The card has three modes:

- **Pending**  -  before `server:sub_agent_started` arrives (rare  -  usually milliseconds). Shows spinner + "Spawning sub-agent - ".
- **Running**  -  after started, before finished. Header shows `agent_type` badge, elapsed time (live), turn count (live from `state:changed`), and a "View full session  - " jump to the child tab. Body is collapsed by default; expanding reveals a lightweight inline transcript of the child (same `ChatPanel` component in read-only mode, height-capped).
- **Completed / Failed / Cancelled**  -  after `server:sub_agent_finished`. Header shows final status + duration + turn count. Body still collapsible; failed and cancelled cards open by default so the reason is visible.

Design constraint: the inline child transcript uses the **same** `ChatPanel` component (recursion). This keeps rendering consistent  -  if the child itself spawns a sub-agent, it renders the same way. We already have the messages via the child's `state:changed` events.

### Composer hint

The Composer's `@` menu is extended: `@agent-name` autocompletes from the registry (fetched via `agent_types:list`), and expands to a directive that the parent LLM can (but is not forced to) turn into an `agent` tool call. This is a nudge, not a mechanism  -  same as `@file` today.

### Explorer indicator

Sessions with `parentSessionId !== null` already appear indented under their parent in Explorer (we have "fork of - " text). Two small changes:

- Distinguish "sub-agent" child from "fork" child by looking at whether the parent's log contains an `agent` tool_call with `callId` = the child's origin. The child record already tracks this via `parentCursor`.
- Add an `agent_type` badge next to the child's title.

## 8. Lifecycle end-to-end

1. **Parent turn.** LLM emits `tool_call { name: 'agent', callId: X, input: { prompt, agent_type?, model?, tools? } }`.
2. **Host loop** (`loop.ts:317`) sees `AGENT_TOOL_NAME`, calls `runAgentTool()`.
3. **`runAgentTool()`**:
   a. Depth check.
   b. Resolve agent type (new): look up in registry, merge into config.
   c. `SessionStore.create()` for the child.
   d. **Emit `server:sub_agent_started`** into the parent's room (new).
   e. `dispatchOne(child, { user_message, text: prompt })`. This runs a full inner loop, emitting `event:appended` / `state:changed` events into the child's own room, which the dashboard is already subscribed to.
   f. On completion, wrap the child's final text in the `<sub_agent>` envelope.
   g. **Emit `server:sub_agent_finished`** into the parent's room (new). Interrupted children use `status: 'cancelled'`.
   h. Return the envelope as `{ ok, content }`.
4. **Loop** feeds the tool_result back into the parent's kernel as a normal `tool_result` event. Parent LLM receives the enveloped text on the next `call_llm` effect.
5. **Dashboard**:
   - On `sub_agent_started`, mark the parent's SubAgentCard as running and open a subscription to the child session.
   - Render child's `event:appended` events inline via a nested `<ChatPanel readOnly>`.
   - On `sub_agent_finished`, freeze the card.
   - Later, when the parent's timeline reloads (e.g. after refresh), the envelope in the `tool_result` content lets the card reconstruct itself without needing the live events  -  `sub_agent:list` RPC gives it the child session ids to fetch on-demand.

## 9. Failure modes

- **Child times out or errors**  -  `runAgentTool()` returns `{ ok: false, content }` with a failed envelope. The parent kernel treats it as a normal tool failure. The dashboard shows the card in `failed` state.
- **Depth exceeded**  -  same, immediate failure envelope. No child session created (so no `sub_agent_started` event). This is the only path where the card renders "immediately failed" without any live-run state.
- **User interrupts child from the parent card**  -  the host marks the active sub-agent as cancelled, dispatches `cancel` to the child session, emits `server:sub_agent_finished` with `status: 'cancelled'`, and returns a cancelled envelope to the parent as a normal failed tool result.
- **Host restart mid-child**  -  child's JSONL log exists; on rehydrate we replay it as a normal session. If it was mid-tool-call, the fold's crash-recovery synthesizes a `tool_error` event, and the child ends up in `error` state. The parent's `agent` tool_call is still pending in the parent's log; on rehydrate the parent kernel synthesizes a matching `tool_error` and the parent LLM gets a failure envelope on its next turn.
- **User rewinds child via `session:fork`**  -  normal fork behavior. The parent's `tool_result` still points to the pre-fork session id via the envelope; the forked session gets a new id and does not affect the parent's log.
- **User cancels parent while child is running**  -  parent cancellation cascades to active child sessions owned by that parent. Each child receives a normal loop `cancel`, so in-flight LLM/tool work is aborted by the same machinery as top-level cancellation. The parent receives a cancelled sub-agent envelope.

## 10. Testing plan

- **Kernel**: no new tests (no reducer changes).
- **Host**:
  - `agent-tool.test.ts` extension: agent-type resolution merges correctly (type + per-call `tools` = intersection).
  - `agent-registry.test.ts`: loading from disk, precedence order, hot reload.
  - `agent-tool.test.ts`: emits `sub_agent_started` and `sub_agent_finished` in the right order with the right payloads, including `cancelled` for parent-cancel cascade.
- **Dashboard**:
  - `SubAgentCard.test.tsx`: renders pending/running/completed/failed/cancelled states from prop inputs and emits `client:interrupt_sub_agent` for a running child.
  - `useSubAgentSession.test.tsx`: subscribes on `sub_agent_started`, unsubscribes on `sub_agent_finished`, matches inline transcript to the child's `event:appended` stream.
  - Envelope parser: handles happy path, malformed envelopes, and legacy pre-envelope tool_results (fall back to plain text).
- **Integration**: an end-to-end test in the host suite spawns a mock child, drives one tool_call turn, asserts both events land and the envelope round-trips.

## 11. Non-goals for this pass

- **Background sub-agents** (Codex-style `spawn_agent` returning immediately). Nice-to-have; not now.
- **Custom sub-agent tool schemas** (Claude Code exposes each agent type as its own tool with tailored input). We keep a single `agent` tool with `agent_type` as an argument. Simpler prompt for the parent.
- **Per-agent-type MCP server allowlisting.** MCP integration is TBD project-wide.
- **Background sub-agent resume/follow-up** (Codex `send_message`/`wait_agent`). Current children are foreground tool calls with live observation and interruption only.

## 12. Open questions

- Should the envelope escape `<`/`>` inside the child's final text? YES  -  otherwise a child that returns HTML/XML confuses the parser. Use HTML entities in `<result>`.
- Should we cap the inline child transcript at N tokens/messages? Probably YES for very long children (>50 turns)  -  a "show all" button expands to full.
- Should the parent LLM see the child's tool calls in its own context? NO  -  that's the whole point of the isolation. Only the wrapped text.
