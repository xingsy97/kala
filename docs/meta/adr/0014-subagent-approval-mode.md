# ADR 0014: Sub-agent sessions force `allow_all` approval mode

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-06

## Context

The host-side `agent` builtin spawns a **child session** under the same workspace. The child runs the same kernel loop, the same tool set, and the same executor as its parent  -  but crucially, **no dashboard is attached to it**. Dashboards subscribe to a specific `sessionId` on the `/dashboard` Socket.IO namespace; a headless child session is never subscribed by any client.

The kernel enforces the approval FSM uniformly: when the current `AgentState.approvalMode` requires approval for a tool call (per the tool's `requiresApproval` flag and the mode's rules), it emits a `RequestApprovalEffect` and parks the pending call in `awaiting_approval`. The state advances only when an `approve` or `reject` event lands.

Before this decision, `loop.ts` seeded the child's initial approval mode by copying the parent's mode:

```ts
initialApprovalMode: parent.state.approvalMode
```

That meant a parent in `auto` (the default) or `ask` produced a child that could park on `awaiting_approval` for any `requiresApproval: true` tool (currently `bash` and `edit`/`write`). With no dashboard listening on the child, the request effect went nowhere and the child hung until its outer `dispatchOne` returned  -  at which point the parent's `agent` tool saw `status: 'awaiting_approval'`, not `'done'`, and reported `tool_result: ok=false, "agent ended with status awaiting_approval"`.

This wasn't a rare edge case  -  it fired the first time any auto/ask parent asked its sub-agent to run bash.

## Decision

**Sub-agent sessions always start with `initialApprovalMode: 'allow_all'`, regardless of the parent's mode.**

Sub-agents run headless. Every effective operator of a sub-agent is the parent agent, not the human  -  and the parent has already been sanctioned (implicitly, by the user having created its parent chain). Making the sub-agent block on approvals nobody can grant is worse than letting it act: it turns every meaningful sub-agent invocation into an opaque failure.

## Alternatives considered

- **B. Proxy approvals from child up to parent's dashboard.** Semantically the "right" answer: the human still gates every tool call the sub-agent wants to run, but the UI aggregates them into the parent's session view. Rejected for v1 because it doubles the approval-request wire protocol (child requests  -  host relays to parent  -  parent dashboard prompts  -  response threads back through the child), and it front-loads engineering work on a UX we haven't validated. Revisit if sub-agents become a heavier surface.
- **C. Inherit and fail fast** (with a clearer error). Preserves the parent's safety posture but makes the `agent` builtin nearly useless whenever the parent isn't in `allow_all`  -  since `bash` is the most useful thing to delegate. Rejected: correct behavior but useless.
- **D. Per-tool safelist for sub-agents.** Approve `read`/`ls`/`grep` unconditionally, deny `bash`/`edit`/`write` unconditionally. More surface area than either A or C, and it removes the parent's ability to delegate exactly the tools that matter most. Rejected as premature.

## Consequences

**Good:**
- The `agent` builtin actually works from any parent approval mode.
- No dead-code paths on the child (approval FSM still evaluates, it just never triggers).
- One-line implementation, easy to reverse when we pick a follow-up.

**Bad  -  deliberate:**
- A parent set to `auto` or `ask` cannot enforce that same posture on its sub-agents. The security boundary is the *parent chain*: whoever authorized the top-level session has implicitly authorized any tool call any descendant makes.
- The `AK_ALLOW_ALL_OK=1` env-gate on `allow_all` at the *dashboard-facing* API is bypassed for child sessions. This is intentional (the child is not human-facing), but worth noting for future security review.
- A malicious or buggy sub-agent prompt can execute arbitrary bash without a second confirmation. The mitigation today is the `maxAgentDepth` recursion guard and the sandboxed workspace roots  -  not per-call approval.

**Follow-up:**
- If sub-agents become a first-class UX (parallel research fan-out, judge panels, long-running background sub-tasks), revisit alternative B  -  proxy approvals through the parent dashboard. Track the decision here or supersede this ADR.
- Consider surfacing "sub-agent is running in `allow_all`" in the dashboard's session-info panel so the human operator understands the child's effective posture.
