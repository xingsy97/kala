# Production Readiness Notes

This document records the major implemented agent-kernel features and the
concrete techniques that keep them close to Claude Code / opencode quality. It
is not a roadmap wishlist; each section names what is already in the code and
the remaining production gap when there is one.

## Reference Baseline

Local references used for this pass:

- `references/openclaw`: production-oriented checks around compaction settings,
  post-compaction guards, skill exposure, permission/liveness state, hooks, and
  subagent registries.
- `references/claude-code-collection`: compact, skill, memory, and subagent
  simplified implementations that show the core shape without product glue.
- `references/codex`: public docs and source layout for sandbox, skills,
  approval, and replay-oriented agent design.

## Context Compaction

Current implementation:

- The kernel derives `contextPressureLevel`; the host runs manual, hard-tier
  auto, and preflight reserve compaction.
- The host picks a recent user-message pivot and preserves that tail verbatim.
- The reducer applies a deterministic `compact_replaced` event with required
  `preserveFrom`, keeping replay/fork stable.
- The summarizer prompt emits a structured engineering handoff, not a generic
  chat summary.
- Old oversized `tool_result` blocks are pruned to head+tail before they enter
  the summarizer request.
- A short post-compaction guard blocks repeated identical tool calls so compacted
  context does not immediately trigger the same failing action loop.

Production techniques:

- Preserve the active working set verbatim. A summary is allowed to replace old
  context, not the current user request or in-progress tool chain.
- Treat compaction as an event-sourced host side effect. The reducer never calls
  an LLM; it only records the resulting replacement.
- Budget the compaction request itself. Stale tool logs are compressed before
  summarization so the summarizer can spend attention on decisions and state.
- Use a fixed handoff schema. Production agents need durable facts: user
  constraints, file paths, commands, failures, and open work.

Remaining gap:

- Token estimation for preflight compaction is approximate and should eventually
  become adapter-aware.
- The post-compaction loop guard is intentionally narrow. It catches repeated
  identical tool calls, not broader semantic loops.

## Tool Output Overflow

Current implementation:

- Executor-side overflow caps in-history tool output at 32 KiB by default.
- Full output is written to `.agent-kernel/overflow/<sessionId>/<callId>.txt`.
- The model receives a preview plus an `overflow://<callId>` marker and a real
  file path it can read if needed.
- The dashboard can fetch full overflow content lazily through the host.
- The preview now preserves both head and tail.
- Fork copies overflow artifacts and session deletion prunes them through
  best-effort executor RPCs.

Production techniques:

- Cap before the next model call. Compaction after the fact cannot recover the
  cost of a giant result already sent to the LLM.
- Keep the tail. Logs and tests often put the decisive error at the bottom;
  head-only truncation is cheap but harms recovery.
- Store overflow outside kernel state. JSONL replay remains deterministic even
  if the side artifact is missing.

Remaining gap:

- Overflow lifecycle is best-effort. If the owning executor is offline during
  fork or deletion, JSONL replay remains correct but side artifacts can be
  missing or stale.

## Skills

Current implementation:

- Skills are exposed through an explicit `skill({ name })` host builtin tool.
- The initial prompt contains only name and description metadata.
- The full `SKILL.md` is loaded only after the model emits the tool call.
- The loader validates names, deduplicates by root priority, rejects malformed
  frontmatter, and refuses files above 256 KiB.

Production techniques:

- Use tool calls as the selection mechanism. This makes skill selection precise,
  inspectable, replayable, and suitable for RL traces.
- Keep discovery lightweight. Descriptions route the model; full instructions
  load on demand.
- Bound loaded instruction size. A skill is privileged context, so unbounded
  markdown is a context-overflow and prompt-injection risk.

Remaining gap:

- Per-skill invocation policy is not implemented. openclaw models
  user-invocable vs model-invocable exposure and requirement checks; this repo
  currently has one global `skill` tool.
- Live skill snapshot refresh is not implemented.

## Sub-Agent Tool

Current implementation:

- `agent` is a host builtin, not an executor tool.
- It creates a child JSONL session, inherits workspace/cwd, enforces depth, and
  returns the child's final assistant text as the parent `tool_result`.
- Child sessions force `allow_all` approval mode to avoid headless approval
  deadlock.

Production techniques:

- Give subagents separate context. Large exploration should not pollute the
  parent working set.
- Persist child sessions. The result is inspectable and replayable instead of a
  hidden nested function call.
- Bound recursion. Agent tools without depth limits can self-spawn until the
  host is unusable.

Remaining gap:

- Long-running subagent suspension/resume is not implemented. openclaw has a
  registry for cross-process delivery and orphan recovery; agent-kernel runs
  child agents synchronously inside the host loop.

## Approval And Permissions

Current implementation:

- Kernel-level approval modes: `auto`, `ask`, `deny`, `allow_all`.
- Tool schemas declare `requiresApproval`; the reducer decides ask/dispatch/
  reject deterministically.
- Host and dashboard expose approval state through normal events and cards.

Production techniques:

- Keep permission decisions in the event stream. Replays should show whether a
  tool was approved, rejected, or auto-dispatched.
- Never let a rejected call disappear. Rejections become synthetic tool results
  so the model can explain or choose another path.

Remaining gap:

- Policy is tool-level only. There is no path-sensitive permission rule for
  `write`/`edit` and no per-skill policy yet.

## Error Handling And Recovery

Current implementation:

- LLM failures become `llm_error` events and move state to `error` with cleared
  pending calls.
- Tool exceptions become failed `tool_result` events.
- Broadcast failures are swallowed after persistence so clients can resubscribe
  and replay.
- Stream cancellation emits a final assistant message with `[cancelled]`,
  avoiding a stuck `thinking` state.
- Session load recovers interrupted `thinking` / pending-tool states through the
  store recovery path.

Production techniques:

- Persist before broadcasting. UI delivery must not be the source of truth.
- Convert crashes into protocol-level terminal events. The state machine should
  never depend on an in-memory promise completing after process death.
- Keep cancellation idempotent. Cancelling with no pending work is a no-op shape
  but still notifies the executor.

Remaining gap:

- Error reasons are strings. Structured categories such as auth, rate limit,
  timeout, and context overflow would make retry and UI handling more precise.

## Dashboard Debuggability

Current implementation:

- The inspector has flattened tabs for Trace, LLM API, Tool Call, and Status.
- LLM API detail shows message assembly and the real provider API request /
  response when adapter traces are captured.
- Tool calls are grouped so a model tool-call request and executor result can be
  viewed as one logical action.

Production techniques:

- Show assembled messages and provider payload separately. Kernel messages are
  provider-neutral; API payload is adapter-specific.
- Redact sensitive endpoints and headers in captured traces.
- Keep raw state behind explicit detail actions. Default debugger views should
  explain state without dumping full JSON.

Remaining gap:

- Trace capture depends on adapter coverage. Any new adapter must include tests
  proving request and response traces are populated and redacted.

## Memory

Current implementation:

- One `memory` tool supports `session`, `workspace`, and `global` scopes.
- Session memory is lifted into kernel state from tool input after successful
  tool results.
- Workspace/global memory are executor-owned files.
- Memory consolidation is manual and writes through the existing tool path.

Production techniques:

- Use one scoped tool rather than many nearly identical memory tools. This keeps
  model affordances compact and avoids registry clutter.
- Lift only session memory into reducer state. Disk-backed scopes stay outside
  replay-critical state.
- Consolidate explicitly. Automatic memory writes can pollute durable context
  with transient or wrong assumptions.

Remaining gap:

- There is no automatic memory relevance retrieval or expiry policy.

## Hooks

Current implementation:

- Host supports `pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`, `session_start`, and
  `session_end` external commands.
- Pre-tool hooks can block a call by returning a non-zero result.
- Hook failures become normal blocked tool results or host errors rather than
  kernel transitions.

Production techniques:

- Hooks are host policy, not reducer logic. They can inspect and block IO while
  keeping the kernel deterministic.
- Timeouts are required. External policy commands must not freeze the agent
  loop indefinitely.

Remaining gap:

- Hook diagnostics are basic. There is no fatal-error hook aggregator like the
  openclaw reference.

## CI And Release Assets

Current implementation:

- GitHub Actions run install, build, typecheck, test, release-asset build, and
  release-asset verification.
- Tag pushes build binary artifacts and upload them to GitHub Releases.

Production techniques:

- Verify release artifacts in CI before uploading. A release pipeline that only
  builds locally is not a release guarantee.
- Keep binary packaging scripted. Manual packaging creates irreproducible
  artifacts.

Remaining gap:

- No signed provenance or checksum publishing beyond the release assets.
