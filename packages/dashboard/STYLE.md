# Dashboard style rules

Concrete rules for surfaces, borders, and separation in the dashboard. Follow these so dark mode stays commercial (Vercel / Linear / Notion vibe) instead of drifting back into "high-contrast wireframe" territory.

Every rule below comes from a real regression the user pushed back on. Don't relax any of them without a matching user request.

---

## 1. The three-surface stack

Panels distinguish themselves through **background luminance**, not lines.

| Token | Dark HSL | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `220 8% 9%` | The chat area, the workbench main column  -  the darkest surface. |
| `--sidebar` | `220 8% 10%` | The Explorer column and other primary side navigation. |
| `--card` | `220 8% 12%` | The workbench toolbar, the composer, elevated panels. |
| `--muted` | `220 8% 15%` | Todo dock, background terminal, small "raised inside a card" surfaces. |
| `--accent` | `220 8% 20%` | Hover states, subtle highlights. |
| `--border` | `220 8% 18%` | Element outlines and internal dividers (see  - 2). |

A 3-point lightness step is the minimum readable separation; a 6-point step reads as clearly "another surface". Prefer the smallest step that still communicates the boundary.

The color has a cool blue tint (H=220, S=8%) rather than pure gray. Do **not** revert to `0 0% N%` achromatic values  -  the resulting dashboard reads as generic/debug, and the user has explicitly rejected that look.

## 2. Border rules  -  the important part

**Never use a bare `border` or `border-t/-b/-l/-r` at a panel boundary between two large surfaces.** That's the "big white line" the user objects to. Use a background step from  - 1 instead.

Concrete pattern that comes up over and over:
- Bad: `border-b border-border bg-background` at the top of Composer / Explorer header / Workbench toolbar
- Good: drop the border, set `bg-card` (or `bg-sidebar-accent/60` for lighter surfaces) so the surface itself steps up

For borders that **must exist** (structure inside a card, dialog header/footer, sidebar column edge, chip outlines), use one of these transparency-bracketed variants  -  never the raw token in dark mode:

| Use case | Class |
|---|---|
| Dialog header/footer divider, dialog outer frame, sidebar column edge, section divider inside a card | `border-border/50` |
| Chip/card outlines that need to be a bit more present (badges on hover, focus states) | `border-border/60` |
| Focus-inside states | `focus-within:border-border` (the full token, only on focus) |

**Bare `border` inherits the full `--border` token**  -  Tailwind's default. In dark mode at 18% lightness this reads as a bright wireframe. If you write `border` with no color modifier and no adjacent transparency, it *is* the bug.

## 3. Dialogs and popovers

Every modal (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`) and every floating surface (`components/ui/select.tsx`, Composer's `/` and `@` popovers) already:

- Uses `bg-background` (or `bg-popover`)  -  the darkest surface, so it visibly sits above the darkened backdrop.
- Uses `shadow-lg`  -  that's the primary depth signal.
- Uses `border border-border/60`  -  a soft rim to catch the corner, not a wireframe outline.

If you build a new floating surface, mirror those three. Don't reach for `border` alone.

## 4. Alert semantics are separate

`border-amber-*`, `border-rose-*`, `border-emerald-*`, `border-sky-*`, `border-violet-*` carry meaning (warning / error / success / info / activity). Those borders are intentionally more present than `border-border/50`. Do not soften them to match  -  they *should* pop against the softer neutral chrome. If they feel loud in dark mode, tune the specific `dark:border-*-900/60` value, not the semantic layer.

## 5. Dividers inside a rendered surface (`bg-border` etc.)

`ChatPanel`'s compact-boundary uses `<div className="h-px flex-1 bg-border/60" />` as a horizontal divider. Same rule: never `bg-border` at full opacity  -  it reads as loud as a `border`. Use `bg-border/60` or lower.

## 6. Kbd chips, hint bars, badges

`<kbd>` in the Composer hint bar (`Enter to send  -  Shift + Enter for newline` etc.) intentionally has **no border**  -  only `rounded bg-muted`. The chip is defined by its background against `bg-card`. Adding `border` back makes each keycap heavy and the hint bar looks like a debug legend.

Same principle for other small inline tokens: badge > background > border. Reach for a border only if the two backgrounds are actually indistinguishable.

## 7. Sub-panels inside a panel (`bg-muted/40` inside a card)

Cards inside cards use half-opacity muted (`bg-muted/40`, `bg-muted/60`) to nest without stacking hard borders. Keep the outer card's border and either drop the inner border or use `border-border/50`.

## 8. When you change any of this

- Rebuild + refresh  -  the CSS is bundled, HMR from a stale dev tab will lie to you.
- Sanity-check in dark mode with the composer, the Explorer, and the New Session dialog open at the same time. That's the "three surfaces + a modal" cross-section where regressions surface fastest.
- Run the existing dashboard tests (`pnpm --filter @agent-kernel/dashboard test`)  -  they don't test appearance but they catch the class of "I removed a divider that some test grepped for by className" mistake.

## 9. Scrollbars

Never expose native browser scrollbars as raw UI chrome. Scrollable dashboard surfaces should use `components/ui/scroll-area.tsx` so the scrollbar is part of the design system and works consistently in dark and light themes.

Allowed exceptions are content-level overflow inside rendered markdown/code (`pre`, long inline traces) and the document root; those are covered by the global thin scrollbar skin in `src/index.css`. If you add `overflow-auto`, `overflow-y-auto`, or `overflow-x-auto`, either replace it with `ScrollArea` or confirm it is a content-level fallback that will inherit the global skin. Do not leave a large panel, popover, dialog body, list, or terminal output on native scrollbar defaults.

For scroll containers that need imperative control, such as auto-following terminal output, use `ScrollArea`'s `viewportRef` rather than putting `overflow-auto` on the content element.

## 10. Anti-patterns  -  do not do these

- `border` (bare)  -  always specify color + transparency
- `dark:border-border`  -  redundant, the token already adapts; adds noise
- `border-b bg-background` at a panel boundary  -  the classic wireframe move; use a bg step
- Hardcoded Tailwind gray scales in dark mode (`dark:border-slate-*`, `dark:bg-zinc-*`)  -  use the semantic tokens instead
- `shadow-sm` in dark mode as a depth signal  -  nearly invisible; use `shadow-lg` for floaters and background steps for panels
- Achromatic HSL (`0 0% N%`)  -  reverts to the debug look
- Bare native scrollbars on panels, popovers, dialogs, lists, or terminal output

## 11. Audit command

To find remaining hard borders:

```bash
# bare `border` with no color modifier
rg -n "\bborder\b(?![-a-zA-Z/])" packages/dashboard/src

# `border-border` at full opacity (should be border-border/50 or /60 unless it's a small chip)
rg -n "border-border[^/-]" packages/dashboard/src

# hard directional borders  -  inspect each hit to decide bg-step vs /50
rg -n "\bborder-[tblr]\b" packages/dashboard/src

# naked overflow scroll containers  -  replace with ScrollArea unless content-level fallback
rg -n "overflow-(auto|scroll|x-auto|y-auto|x-scroll|y-scroll)" packages/dashboard/src
```

CI runs these as a ratchet via `pnpm --filter @agent-kernel/dashboard lint:style` (script in `scripts/lint-style.mjs`, baseline in `scripts/lint-style.baseline.json`). Counts may not increase; ratchet the baseline down as you clean up hits with `pnpm --filter @agent-kernel/dashboard lint:style -- --write`.
