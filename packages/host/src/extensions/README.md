# Host extensions

Optional capabilities layered on top of the host loop. **Each file here is
something the kernel does not need to run.** The runtime composes them at
startup through `ExtensionRegistry`; removing a registration removes that
capability without adding a tool-name branch to the loop. This is the concrete
expression of [ADR 0005](../../../../docs/meta/adr/0005-kernel-boundary.md):
planning, memory, and subagents live *outside* the kernel, and — by the same
logic — outside the core host driver too.

Contrast with the modules one level up in `src/` (`loop.ts`, `llm/`, `store/`,
`connection/`, `server.ts`): those are the **kernel driver**. Remove any of them
and nothing runs. The split is physical so a reader can tell "required skeleton"
from "bolt-on" at a glance.

## The dependency rule

Extensions depend on the loop's **contract**, never on the loop's guts:

```
extensions/*.ts ──imports──▶ ../loop-types.ts    (pure host-loop contracts)
extensions/*.ts ──imports──▶ ../loop.ts          (only where re-entry is required)
../loop.ts      ──imports──▶ registry.ts         (generic lifecycle contract)
builtin-registry.ts ───────▶ concrete extensions (startup composition)
```

`loop-types.ts` is a leaf module (no runtime logic, imports nothing that imports
it back), so the type dependency doesn't close a cycle. The loop imports each
extension's entry function; the extension imports only types plus `dispatchOne`.
That one-way shape is what keeps the core readable in isolation — you can read
`loop.ts` top to bottom and treat every extension as a named seam.

Extensions with **no** core dependency at all (`hooks.ts`, `skills.ts` — pure
functions over child processes / the filesystem) don't even import
`loop-types.ts`.

## Registered contributions

The sealed registry owns capability discovery and deterministic lifecycle
ordering. Extensions can contribute Session modes, Host tool handlers,
maintenance operations, and lifecycle callbacks:

| Contribution | Registry surface | Built-in owners |
|---|---|---|
| Session lifecycle | `sessionCreated`, `sessionLoaded`, `sessionDeleted` | command hooks, skills |
| State and turn lifecycle | `beforeStateTransition`, `beforeTurn`, `afterTurn` | skills, auto-compaction, durable-work recovery |
| Model lifecycle | `beforeModelCall`, `afterModelCall` | preflight compaction |
| Tool lifecycle | `beforeToolDispatch`, `dispatchHostTool`, `afterToolDispatch` | command hooks and Host tools |
| Cancellation | `cancel` | subagent cleanup |
| Recovery | `recoverSession` | extension-owned recovery contributors |
| Maintenance | `compact`, `consolidateMemory` | compaction and memory |
| Session modes | `listSessionModes`, `getSessionMode` | Standard Chat; orchestration modes register separately |

Each single-owner contribution is validated during registration. Duplicate
Session mode IDs, Host handler names, compaction owners, and memory
consolidation owners fail startup. Multi-contributor lifecycle callbacks run in
registration order and propagate errors unless the contribution explicitly
defines advisory behavior, as command session hooks do.

## The files

| File | Phase(s) | Depends on core? |
|---|---|---|
| `compaction.ts` | beforeModelCall, afterTurn, maintenance | types + `dispatchOne` |
| `agent-tool.ts` | provideTool | types + `dispatchOne` + `SessionStore` |
| `hooks-runner.ts` | beforeCallTool, afterCallTool | types only |
| `hooks.ts` | discovery (runner) | no — pure, `node:child_process` |
| `skills.ts` | provideTool, discovery | no — pure, kernel `ToolSchema` only |
| `memory-consolidation.ts` | maintenance | types only |
| `registry.ts` | Session, turn, model, tool, cancellation, recovery, maintenance, and mode contracts | host-loop contract types |
| `builtin-registry.ts` | startup composition | concrete extension entry points |

## Agent modules and toolsets

The default host assembles its agent surface through `AgentModule`:

```
AgentModule = SystemPromptPlugin + ToolsetPlugin[] + RuntimePolicyPlugin?
```

`SystemPromptPlugin` owns the provider-facing system prompt. Each
`ToolsetPlugin` owns a named toolset, including tool prompt text, risk policy,
execution kind, and the handler name. The renderer in `src/agent-modules/`
turns that richer structure into the plain kernel `AgentConfig`: a system
prompt, `ToolSchema[]`, and compact `agentModule` metadata.

Tool execution uses the same rendered metadata. `loop.ts` delegates tool calls
to `dispatchConfiguredTool()`, which routes `executionKind: 'executor'` tools to
the executor and resolves `executionKind: 'host'` handlers through the sealed
registry. Registration rejects duplicate extension IDs and duplicate handler
ownership. Startup seals the registry before sessions run, so runtime behavior
cannot mutate midway through a session. The historical `websearch` routing
compatibility rule remains in the dispatcher for persisted sessions.

The session header stores the rendered module metadata. On session creation, the
host also writes `agent-module/system-prompt.txt` and
`agent-module/tool-registry.json` artifacts beside the JSONL log so a run can be
audited or reproduced without reconstructing startup state from code.
